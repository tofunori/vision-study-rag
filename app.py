## Welcome to Vision Study RAG!

This application helps you study your PDF documents using:
1. PDF-to-image conversion with visual awareness
2. Embedding generation with vision models
3. Vector storage
4. Semantic search capabilities

### Coming Soon:
- Full compatibility with Python 3.13
- Complete implementation of ColPali image embeddings
- Local vector database integration
- LLM response generation through Ollama

### Current Status:
The UI framework is in place, but the backend services need to be adapted for the latest Python version.
